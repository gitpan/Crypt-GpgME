        * Fix a coredump when gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem returned NULL.
        * Use gpgme functions to convert algos/protos to strings.
          This is an incompatible change as the proto/algo names were
          previously returned in lower case (i.e. 'OpenPGP' was called 'openpgp'
          in version 0.02 and below).
        * Build depend on File::Which.
        * Make Test::MockModule optional for the tests.
        * Don't auto_include things anymore.
